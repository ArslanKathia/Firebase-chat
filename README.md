# Firebase chat - Android - Material Design

This example was created for a CodeLab in the Google Developers Summit Mexico City 25 julio 2015 [GDS Mexico](https://events.withgoogle.com/gds-mexico-city-25-julio-2015/agenda/).

I updated the example firebase android chat created by firebase using the concept of material design.

 **Slides** [firebase Codelabs](https://speakerdeck.com/erikcaffrey/firebase) created by Erik Gonz치lez and Antonio Guzm치n. 

## Setup

Update [`Config.java`](/app/src/main/java/gdg/androidtitlan/androidchatmaterialdesign/Config.java) and replace
`https://android-chat-gds.firebaseio.com/` with a reference to your Firebase.

## Features

 * **Material Design Theme**
 * **RecyclerView**
 * **CardView**
 * **Toolbar**
 * **Fragment** 
 * **Firebase SDK**
 * **Email & Password Authentication** Firebase makes it easy to integrate email and password authentication into your app
 [lean more](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/login/password.html).
 

Firebase keeps the list data up to date based on a mapping to a model class.
